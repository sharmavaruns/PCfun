### WORKFLOW

Inputs:
1) Protein complex queries: file with 'PC Name'\t'Subunit_UniProt1,Subunit_UniProt2,Subunit_UniProtN'
2) UniProt to GeneName map
3) Path to word embedding
4) Path to trained ML Models
5) Input GO Terms, .obo file
6) Path to KDTree files
7) path to CORUM file
8) Built command line version of fasttext

Outputs:
1) Folder structure with
    - PC query:
        a) Functionally Enriched terms and their tree pictures
        b) ML results
        c) KDTree results
     
     
     
Scripts:
1) mapping.py: ## Module of functions- NOT A CALLABLE SCRIPT WITH I/O
Input: tsv with first column corresponding to original Protein complex name and second
second with pre-recorded Gene Names, and optional third with Uniprot subunits, and
Arguments:
- "--Complex_name" (Bool)
- "--Gene_name" (Bool, optional)
- "--UniProt_ids" (Bool)

Output: text processed names and corresponding dictionary with word vectors


2) kdtree_nns.py
Input: word vectors output from 'Parse_tsv_to_vecs.py'
Arguments:
- "--GO" all (default: all, optionally can choose single with specific GO name: MF, BP, or CC)
- "--tree_path" /path/to/custom/tree.pickle (Optional if one has created custom kd_tree- make_trees functionality)
Output: KDTree results organized as dictionaries of pd.DataFrames
[Should probably have accompanying write_out function (maybe make this into a class)]

3) supervised_rf_results.py
Input: word vectors output from 'Parse_tsv_to_vecs.py'
Arguments:
- "--GO" all (default: all, optionally can choose single with specific GO name: MF, BP, or CC)
Output: Supervised results organized as dictionaries of pd.DataFrames
[Should probably have accompanying write_out function (maybe make this into a class)]

4) functional_enrichment.py
Input: outputs of supervised_results.py and kdtree_nns.py
Output: Directories with subdirectory structure of:
    - PC
        - BP
            - supervised results
            - KDTree results (top 200)
            - functional enrichment table
            - Tree Diagrams (dir)
        - MF
            - supervised results
            - KDTree results (top 200)
            - functional enrichment table
            - Tree Diagrams (dir)
        - CC
            - supervised results
            - KDTree results (top 200)
            - functional enrichment table
            - Tree Diagrams (dir)
