### Steps I'm following in order to try and install correct packages and basically get everything going
1) First cloned PCfun into PyCharm VCS by logging into my github account through the provided link and clicked on PCfun
2) Made a new conda environment python interpreter through PyCharm available for this project called 'PCfun'
    where I'm trying to get everything installed correctly and working through
3) git status ## showed that I was on master branch so I wanted to switch to test3
4) git checkout test3 ## to switch to test3 branch
5) git pull
6) git fetch ## Frankly I don't know difference between git pull and git fetch so I just do both each time
    ## this appears to have gotten me the files that I want from Matteo's commits
7) Added interact and numpy, pandas versions from interact's requirements.txt file to mine
7) pip install -r requirements.txt ## I want to install the required packages via requirements.txt
    ## However, I haven't figured out how to properly use the setup.py script yet
    ## This seems to have installed the dependencies I want atm. But still confused in regards to fasttext
8)

### Somehow I need to not include this
